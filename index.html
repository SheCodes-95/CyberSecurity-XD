        <h1>CYBER SECURITY</h1>
        <h2>alert('Hello ${user.name}');</h2>
        <p>From ordering a taxi to booking a room. There are billions of bytes of information
            moving every second
            The Internet has gotten big. Scary BIG. 
            The average user is not aware of all the dangers lurking on the Web
        </p>

    <div class="left-one">
      <h1>WHY BOTHER?</h1>
    <p>With the great ocean of information and data around, a golden age has been created for black hat hackers.
        There are more than enough vulnebilities to exploit. Basic SySec knowledge is a must in this day and age
    </p>

    <div class="right-one">
        <h1>WHAT'S IT?</h1>
        <p>The name says it all. It's the practice of keeping a company or your data safe from malicious attackers With
            harmful intentions. Be it hardware or software<br>
            <br>
            As companies get bigger and bigger and generate more and more data, Cyber Security has become 
            mandatory. Hell yeah job security! Or is it security job......

        <h1>CIA TRIAD</h1>
        <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
        <p>Ensuring privacy to prevent the wrong people from accessing your information. 
            Only grants accessingto authorized persons</p>
            <h3>INTEGRITY</h3>
            <P>If proper systems are in place, attackers will have a hard time getting in. Small bit
                of security goes a long way
            </P>
            <h3>AVAILABILITY</h3>
            <p>Is access to your data retricted to only authorised people?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="right-two">
        <h1>PREVENTION</h1>
        <p>Safety is only a feeling. If someone wants to get in, they will get in. It's our responsibility to implement systems, practices
            and incident response plans. <br>
            <br>
            These systems hinder any attacker. The longer they take, the more time you will have to 
                launch a counter attack!

    <div class="left-three">
        <h1>WE PROTECT FROM</h1>
        <p>The CIA is used as a core reference(The Three Pillars of Security) for protecting against unauthorised access, 
            deletion and modification. All companies following proper CySec regulations follow tThe Three Pillars.
            How long can a building stand without pillars for support

    <div class="right-three">
        <h1>I'M IN</h1>
        <p>Once a hacker is in, there's really not much you can do. Pulling the cables always works on the other 
            hand..... <br>
            (seriously, don't ever do that....)
            <br>
            Doing Risk Assessment is the staring point for understanding where the vulnebilities are that a potential hacker could exploit.

       <p>creating scripts that track a user's activity would make it easier to determine suspecious activitywhen an attacker strikes.
           Alerts could be sent to admin when there is large file download or unsual login methods. immediate credential changes could be executed
